# Tōku-Whare
Wellbeing/Houora app for kids. Using a hollistic approach built around Sir Mason Durie's Te Whare Tapa Whā model, this app is designed to help kids connect with and take ownership of their wellbeing in all meanings of the word - Taha Tinana (physical), Taha Hinengaro (mental and emotional), Taha Wairua (spiritual/personal values), Taha Whānau (social), and Whenua (connection to nature and their roots). Tōku Whare allows kids to build a plan to manage their wellbeing - a way to find solutions when things aren't feeling quite right. Tōku Whare also allows teachers and caregivers to introduce concepts of Māoritanga to students, and to better connect with their needs. Built as a final group project for the Dev Academy bootcamp, Tohora 2022 cohort.
